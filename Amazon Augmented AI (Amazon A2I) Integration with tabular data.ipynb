    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) makes it easy to build the workflows required for human review of ML predictions. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own workflows for ML models built on Amazon SageMaker or any other tools. Using Amazon A2I, you can allow human reviewers to step in when a model is unable to make a high confidence prediction or to audit its predictions on an on-going basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more here: https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how you can use **Amazon A2I with Tabular data.** Tabular data is the most common form of data used by data scientists today for generating models. Use cases include, fraud detection, building customer propensity models, forecasting sales using regression etc. In many cases, data scientists often convert unstructured data such as text or images into structured tables that they then use for training models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will first train a model and use the outputs of the trained model to build a human loop for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depth instructions, visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "To incorporate Amazon A2I into your human review workflows, you need three resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **worker task template** to create a worker UI. The worker UI displays your input data, such as documents or images, and instructions to workers. It also provides interactive tools that the worker uses to complete your tasks. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-instructions-overview.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human review workflow**, also referred to as a flow definition. You use the flow definition to configure your human workforce and provide information about how to accomplish the human review task. You can create a flow definition in the Amazon Augmented AI console or with Amazon A2I APIs. To learn more about both of these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-create-flow-definition.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human loop** to start your human review workflow. When you use one of the built-in task types, the corresponding AWS service creates and starts a human loop on your behalf when the conditions specified in your flow definition are met or for each object if no conditions were specified. When a human loop is triggered, human review tasks are sent to the workers as specified in the flow definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a custom task type, as this tutorial will show, you start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API. When you call `start_human_loop()` in your custom application, a task is sent to human reviewers."
